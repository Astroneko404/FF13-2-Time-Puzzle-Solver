# A Test Report for FF13-2 Time Puzzle Solver

## Introduction
The time puzzle in Final Fantasy 13-2 is officially called "The Hands of Time". Players need to erase all number pads in the screen. Each time when a number pad is visited, one or two clock hand(s) will appear, pointing to the possible next number pads to visit. If both clock hands point to empty space, while there still exist other number pads in the field, it is time to retry the puzzle.
